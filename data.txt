You can pick a version of <code xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">main</code> that makes sense for your teaching style.

This is very cool.Students can write Java code that directs the Alice models. For example, oneassignment asks students to make a <code xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Car</code> class whose<code xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">drive</code> method moves the car and reduces the gas in the tank. (Icouldn't find a gas gauge, so I used the cat clock. The tail moves to the leftas the tank gets emptier.) I provide the code for moving the car and rotatingthe tail, and the students compute the gas consumption.</div>  </dd><dt>2009-08-10</dt><dd>  <p class="blogimage"><img src="2009-08-10/piece-of-cake.jpg" alt="blog image"/></p>  <p class="blogtitle"><a href="https://horstmann.com/unblog/2009-08-10/a-spoonful-of-scala.html">A spoonful of Scala</a></p>  <div class="blogdescription">I write my lecture slides in XHTML, using the marvelous <a href="http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">HTML Slidy</a> package.

The app needs &quot;all permissions&quot;, so I simply signed it with a worthless    self-signed certificate. The Web Start security dialog is complete    gibberish to 99% of end users, which works in my favor. Something is wrong    here. Should the JNLP API be less convoluted, so that it is easier to live    in the sandbox. Should it be less of a hassle for an individual to get a    real certificate?</div>  </dd><dt>2006-07-05</dt><dd>  <p class="blogimage"><img src="2006-07-05/images/ebnf.jpg" alt="blog image"/></p>  <p class="blogtitle"><a href="https://horstmann.com/unblog/2006-07-05/railroad.html">Railroad Diagrams</a></p>  <div class="blogdescription">Does anyone still use railroad diagrams (AKA syntax    diagrams)?

I'd like you to consider    switching to Linux. It's not cool, but you get to enjoy freedom from    crapware and forced upgrades, keyboard shortcuts, and great Java support.    There is just one drawback. Unlike the Mac crowd with their    distinctive-looking hardware, you'll need a garish Linux sticker so that    the world can see you aren't running Windows.</div>  </dd><dt>2006-06-13</dt><dd>  <p class="blogimage"><img src="2006-06-13/images/mad-scientist.jpg" alt="blog image"/></p>  <p class="blogtitle"><a href="https://horstmann.com/unblog/2006-06-13/mustang-ubuntu.html">Honey, I built the JDK!

This is good news if you want to tinker with the JDK on Ubuntu.    Even if you don't, it is comforting to know that the Mustang build process    is robust enough to allow the tinkerers to use it on their favorite    platform, so that you can benefit from their labors. </div>  </dd><dt>2006-06-09</dt><dd>  <p class="blogimage"><img src="2006-06-09/images/agent.jpg" alt="blog image"/></p>  <p class="blogtitle"><a href="https://horstmann.com/unblog/2006-06-09/agent-mystery.html">The innermost secrets of -javaagent:toplink-essentials-agent.jar    revealed</a></p>  <div class="blogdescription">I had been mystified by what exactly the magic    incantation -javaagent:toplink-essentials-agent.jar does for JPA clients,    and my experiments had been inconclusive.

Ok, you say, Eclipse writes it for you. But    you still have to read it. Pages and pages of it in many real life    classes. My graduate student Alexandre Alves implemented a Mustang    compiler extension to remove the drudgery. We want to get this feature    into Dolphin and need your help.
